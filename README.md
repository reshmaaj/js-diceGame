# 🎲 Dice Game

Just a tiny project where two dice fight for glory... every time you refresh the page.

## 🤷🏼‍♀️ What is this?

I made this while following a full stack web development course on Udemy.  
It’s basically a page that rolls two dice and tells you who wins — Player 1, Player 2, or no one (draw... boring, I know).

## 🛠️ Tech used:

- HTML (to hold stuff)
- CSS (to make it not ugly)
- JavaScript (to make the dice actually roll)

## 🎮 How to play?

1. Open the page.
2. Refresh.
3. Boom! Instant winner. Or not.
4. Wanna try your luck?

## ⚠️ Disclaimer:

No actual dice were harmed during the making of this game.

That's it. Nothing fancy. Just roll with it 😉
